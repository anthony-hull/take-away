I pre-designed the classes and object structure:

 https://dashboard.genmymodel.com/projectProperties/_-07cYH4AEemtbe7XArhuwQ
I then built each class one by one.

please make an .ENV file with the following:

TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=
MY_PHONE_NUMBER=

STill need to add order manager functionality:
To check basket total against user input at order confirmation stage
To call Twilio to send message
Tell basket to add parsed order items to the basket.

Change some Vacuous tests to be useful or delete.



Update Twilio tests to not be useless.
